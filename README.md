# lsb-Image-Steganography-java
This project implements Image Steganography in Java using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. It securely embeds a secret image inside a cover image by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values, ensuring minimal visual distortion. The system also supports extraction of the hidden image from the encoded output image.
